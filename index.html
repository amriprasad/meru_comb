      <p class="w3-text-grey">Binomial Edge Ideals Associated to Finite Simple Graphs and their Algebraic Invariants</p>
      <p>
        In 2009-2010, Herzog et al. and independently Ohtani introduced the concept of binomial edge ideal associated to finite simple graphs. They studied the properties of these ideals with a combinatorial point of view. Since then, there have been a lot of research on the connection between the algebraic properties of the ideals and the combinatorial properties of the graph. In this series of talks, I will introduce the ideal and discuss some of the important connection between the associated algebraic and combinatorial invariants. Towards the end I will discuss about some open problems in this direction and some other directions for future research.

        <p class="w3-text-grey">Combinatorics of Partitions</p>
    	<p>
        The fundamental theorems in $q$-series such as the $q$-bionomial theorem, Jacobi triple product identity and Euler’s pentagonal number theorem will be discussed followed by applications of the elementary series-product identities to partitions. In this part, the combinatorial techniques in partition theory involving generating functions as well as bijective proofs will be introduced. For example, Legendre's combinatorial interpretation of Euler's pentagonal theorem and its bijective proof due to Franklin will be discussed. Properties of Gaussian polynomials will also be considered.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will then focus on Ramanujan's well-known congruence for the partition function $p(n)$ modulo $5$, $7$, and $11$ and some of the partition statistics associated with them such as ranks and cranks. We will also introduce recently studied restricted partition functions which give simple combinatorial interpretations of some of the third order mock theta functions of Ramanujan.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, analytic and combinatorial versions of Rogers-Ramanujan identities will be discussed along with the applications of the latter. If time permits, we will also delve into miscellaneous topics in partition theory, for example, MacMahon's partition analysis and plane partitions.

        <p>Some recent results on fractional intersecting families<br><hr>
        For a fraction $\theta = a/b$ in $(0,1)$, a family $\mathcal{F}$ of subsets of $[n]$ is called a "fractional $\theta$-intersecting family" if, for every pair of distinct sets $A, B \in \mathcal{F}$, we have $\lvert A \cap B \rvert = \theta \lvert A \rvert$ or $\theta \lvert B \rvert$. The natural extremal question is: How large can a $\theta$-intersecting family over $[n]$ be?

          This notion was introduced in Balachandran--Mathew--Mishra (Electron. J. Combin. 26 (2019), #P2.40), wherein they showed that $\lvert \mathcal{F} \rvert \leq O(n \log n)$, and they gave constructions of $\theta$-intersecting families of size at least $\Omega(n)$. The conjecture (which is still open) is that $\lvert \mathcal{F} \rvert \leq O(n)$ for any $\theta$-intersecting family $\mathcal{F}$ over $[n]$.
          
          In this talk, I will discuss some recent progress on this conjecture, and some related questions concerning ranks of certain matrix ensembles, tournaments, symmetric designs, and sunflowers.</p>

        <p>Characterization of $\theta$-free Matching Covered Graphs<br><hr>
          A nontrivial connected graph is matching covered if each edge belongs to some perfect matching. For most problems pertaining to perfect matchings, one may restrict attention to matching covered graphs; thus, there is an extensive theory on them. A cornerstone of this theory is an ear decomposition result due to Lov\'asz and Plummer. Their theorem is a fundamental problem-solving tool, and also yields interesting open problems; we discuss two such problems below, and we solve one of them.

          A subgraph $H$ of a graph $G$ is {\it conformal} if $G-V(H)$ has a perfect matching. This notion is intrinsically related to the aforementioned ear decomposition theorem --- which implies that each matching covered graph (apart from $K_2$ and even cycles) contains a conformal bisubdivision of $\theta$, or a conformal bisubdivision of $K_4$, possibly both. (Here, $\theta$ refers to the graph with two vertices joined by three edges.) This immediately leads to two problems: characterize $\theta$-free (likewise, $K_4$-free) matching covered graphs. A characterization of planar $K_4$-free matching covered graphs was obtained by Kothari and Murty $(2016)$; the nonplanar case is still open.
          
          We provide a complete characterization of $\theta$-free matching covered graphs --- that is closely tied with the tight cut decomposition theory of matching covered graphs.  </p>

        <p>Square roots and character table sum<br><hr>
          The column sums of the character table of a finite group are always integers, which may also be negative. However, for finite Weyl groups (eg. symmetric group) these are non-negative. This is due to Frobenius and Schur, who interpreted column sums in terms of number of square roots of respective conjugacy classes. In this talk, we use their result to prove the validity of an intriguing property for Weyl groups (applicable to most finite groups) "The first column sum ( which records the dimensions of the irreducibles) dominate the sum of rest columns". While this property holds for any abelian group, generalized dihedral, and quaternionic groups, there are also a few exceptions. If time permits, we shall discuss the asymptotical behavior of the character table sums and derive their generating functions. This is an ongoing work with Arvind Ayyer and Hiranya Kishore Dey.</p>

        <p>Koszul Duality for Schur Algebras and $q$-Schur Algebras<br><hr>
          The category of degree $d$ polynomial representations of $GL_{n}(\mathbb{C})$ is isomorphic to the category of modules of the Schur algebra $S=S(n,d)$, $d\geq 0$. The $q$-Schur algebra $S_{q}(n,d)$ is a quantum analogue of Schur algebra $S(n,d)$ whose module theory essentially captures polynomial representations of the quantum general linear group $GL_{q}(n)$. Geetha, Prasad and Srivastava (Pac. J. Math., 2020) defined the Koszul duality functor $D:S-\text{Mod} \xrightarrow{} S-\text{Mod}$
          by $D(M)=S^{-}\otimes_{S} M$. This functor takes the Weyl module $W_{\lambda}$ to $W_{\lambda^{'}}$, for any partition $\lambda$ of $d$ with atmost $n$ parts. We will see an analogue of the Koszul duality functor for the $q$-Schur algebra $S_{q}(n,d)$. This is part of an ongoing work with A.~Prasad.

        <p>Zero-sum Problems for Restricted Sequences<br><hr>
          Zero-sum problems are basically combinatorial in nature. It deals with the condition that ensures that a given sequence over a finite group has a zero-sum subsequence with some prescribed properties. There are many invariants associated with zero-sum problems. Some such invariants are the Davenport constant, the Erdős-Ginzburg-Ziv constant, and the Harborth constant. The original motivation for introducing such group invariant was to study the problem of non-unique factorization domain over number fields. The precise value of such group invariants even for any finite abelian group are still unknown. In this talk, I will be discussing zero-sum problems over in some particular category of sequences. Moreover, we will study the behaviour of zero-sum invariants for random sequences.

        <p>Sign-balance of excedances over Parity Alternating Permutations<br><hr>
          A permutation is called parity alternating if its entries assume even and odd integers alternately. In 2010, Tanimoto proved that the number of even non-parity alternating permutations with $k$ descents is same as the number of odd non-parity alternating permutations with $k$ descents. The objective of this paper is two-fold. 
          The first is to find out whether an excedance counterpart of Tanimoto's result is true. The second is to find out the sign-balance for parity alternating permutations with respect to the statistic excedance. The results of this paper can be considered as an applications of linear algebraic techniques in the area of combinatorics, which are obtained by constructing suitable matrices and connecting their determinants with the signed-excedance enumeration of parity alternating permutations. As an application of the signed excedance enumeration, we prove that when $n \equiv 2 \pmod 4$, the excedance enumerating polynomials over the even and odd parity alternating permutations starting with an odd integer in $\mathfrak{S}_n$ are gamma positive. The sign-balance of parity alternating permutations with respect to several other statistics are also obtained.

          We use the tiling method to give elementary combinatorial proofs of some celebrated q-series identities, such as Jacobi triple product identity, Rogers-Ramanujan identities, and some identities of Rogers. We give a tiling proof of the q-binomial theorem and a tiling interpretation of the q-binomial coefficients. A new generalized k-product q-series identity is also obtained by employing the `tiling-method', wherein the generating function of the set of all possible tilings of a rectangular board is computed in two different ways to obtain the desired q-series identity. Several new recursive q-series identities were also established. The `tiling-method' holds promise for giving an aesthetically pleasing approach to prove old and new q-series identities.

          <p>Solitary edges in cubic graphs<br><hr>
            Extensive research has been conducted on $2$-connected cubic~(aka $3$-regular) graphs. Petersen (1891) proved that every $2$-connected cubic graph has a perfect matching; and Sch\""onberger (1934) showed that each edge in a $2$-connected cubic graph is part of some perfect matching. In light of these well-known results, we set out to characterize those $2$-connected cubic graphs in which every edge is part of at least two perfect matchings.
          </p>
          <p>
            An edge is referred to as a {\em solitary edge} if it belongs to a unique perfect matching.
            Thus, we can restate our objective as characterizing all $2$-connected cubic graphs that do not contain any solitary edges. In case of $2$-connected, there are graphs with $\frac{n}{2}$ solitary edges, where $n$ is the number of vertices. The problem turns out to be more interesting in the case of $3$-connected graphs. We have successfully established a constant upper bound (namely, six) on the number of solitary edges in $3$-connected cubic graphs.\par
            A connected graph $G$ with two or more vertices is said to be {\em matching covered} if each edge is part of at least one perfect matching. The concept of dependency relationship between edges, in a matching covered graph, was formally introduced and studied by Carvalho, Lucchesi and Murty~(1999). In a matching covered graph $G$, the dependency relationship between edges $e$ and $f$ may be defined as follows: edge $e$ depends on edge $f$, denoted as $e \rightarrow f$, if every perfect matching that includes edge $e$ also includes edge $f$, and edges $e$ and $f$ are mutually dependent, denoted as $e \leftrightarrow f$, if both $e \rightarrow f$ and $f \rightarrow e$. It is worth noting that mutual dependence is an equivalence relation implies it partitions the edge set $E(G)$ into distinct equivalence classes. The parts of this partition are referred to as the {\em equivalence classes} of $G$. And we refer to an equivalence class, say $R$, as a {\em removable class} if $G-R$ is matching covered. We say any two edges in a matching covered graph are {\em mutually exclusive} if there is no perfect matching that contains both the edges. The set of solitary edges in a $3$-connected cubic graph may be partitioned into $3$ (possibly empty) parts so that any two edges in the same part are mutually dependent, any two edges in the distinct parts are mutually exclusive, and each part has cardinality at most two; we refer to part of cardinality one as {\em solitary singleton} and part of cardinality two as {\em solitary doubleton}. We provide a complete characterization of all cubic 3-connected graphs that have at least three solitary edges.\par
            This is joint work with Kalyani Gohokar (CMI), Ajit Diwan (IIT Bombay) and Nishad Kothari (IIT Madras). This work is not yet published.

            bipartite graph $G$ with a unique perfect matching on $2p$ vertices is a $p\times p$ matrix whose $(i, j)$th
            entry is the distance between vertices $l_i$ and $r_j$, where $L:=\{l_1,\ldots,l_p\}$, $R:=\{r_1,\ldots,r_p\}$ is a vertex bipartition of $G$.
            We observe that $\det {B}(G)$ is always a multiple of $2^{p-1}$.  
            Based on this observation, we define the {\em bipartite distance index} of $G$ as $\texttt{bd}(G):=\det  {B}(G)/ (-2)^{p-1}$.
          </p>
          <p>
            We demonstrate that the bipartite distance index of a nonsingular tree $T$ satisfies an interesting inclusion-exclusion
            type of principle at any matching edge of the tree.
            Furthermore, we fully characterize  the bipartite distance index of a nonsingular tree  $T$ by the structure of   $T$ through what we term $f$-alternating sums.
          </p>
          <p>
            The study of the inverse of the bipartite distance matrix  leads to an unexpected generalization of the usual Laplacian matrix for a tree, referred to as the  bipartite Laplacian matrix.  This generalized Laplacian matrix is usually not symmetric but it shares many properties with the usual Laplacian matrix.
            We study some of the fundamental properties of the bipartite Laplacian matrix and compare them with those of the usual Laplacian matrix. Lastly, we present a combinatorial description of all minors of the bipartite Laplacian matrix for a nonsingular tree.

          <p>Roots of identity in finite groups of Lie type<br><hr>
            Given an integer $M\geq 2$, we deploy the generating function techniques to compute the number of $M$-th roots of identity in some of the well-known finite groups of Lie type, more precisely for finite general linear groups, symplectic groups, orthogonal groups of all types and unitary groups over finite fields of odd characteristics.
