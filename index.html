      <p class="w3-text-grey">Binomial Edge Ideals Associated to Finite Simple Graphs and their Algebraic Invariants</p>
      <p>
        In 2009-2010, Herzog et al. and independently Ohtani introduced the concept of binomial edge ideal associated to finite simple graphs. They studied the properties of these ideals with a combinatorial point of view. Since then, there have been a lot of research on the connection between the algebraic properties of the ideals and the combinatorial properties of the graph. In this series of talks, I will introduce the ideal and discuss some of the important connection between the associated algebraic and combinatorial invariants. Towards the end I will discuss about some open problems in this direction and some other directions for future research.

    	<p>
        The fundamental theorems in $q$-series such as the $q$-bionomial theorem, Jacobi triple product identity and Euler’s pentagonal number theorem will be discussed followed by applications of the elementary series-product identities to partitions. In this part, the combinatorial techniques in partition theory involving generating functions as well as bijective proofs will be introduced. For example, Legendre's combinatorial interpretation of Euler's pentagonal theorem and its bijective proof due to Franklin will be discussed. Properties of Gaussian polynomials will also be considered.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will then focus on Ramanujan's well-known congruence for the partition function $p(n)$ modulo $5$, $7$, and $11$ and some of the partition statistics associated with them such as ranks and cranks. We will also introduce recently studied restricted partition functions which give simple combinatorial interpretations of some of the third order mock theta functions of Ramanujan.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, analytic and combinatorial versions of Rogers-Ramanujan identities will be discussed along with the applications of the latter. If time permits, we will also delve into miscellaneous topics in partition theory, for example, MacMahon's partition analysis and plane partitions.

        <p>Arithmetic Properties of Overpartition $k$-Tuples with Odd Parts<br><hr>
        We prove several congruences for overpartition $k$-tuples with odd parts modulo powers of $2$, we prove a few infinite family of congruences for overpartition triples with odd parts and for overpartition $k$-tuples with odd parts (for $k=4$ and for an odd $k$). In addition, we discuss density results for overpartition $k$-tuples with odd parts modulo powers of primes. Our results are proved using elementary means as well as properties of modular forms.

        <p>An involution on reduced words and signed descent length enumeration<br><hr>
          Signed enumeration allows one to pass from the statistics on the Symmetric groups to statistics on the Alternating subgroup. Various signed enumeration results are known such as for excedance, excedance length, descent etc. We give an sign reversing involution that shows that
          $$\sum_{\pi \in S_n} \mathrm{sgn}(\pi)t^{\mathrm{exc}(\pi)}p^{\mathrm{exclen}(\pi)}q^{\mathrm{desclen}(\pi)}=(1−tpq)^{n−1},$$
          where $\mathrm{exc}$ is the excedance number, 
          $\mathrm{exclen}$ is the excedance length and 
          $\mathrm{desclen}$ is the descent length. Setting 
          $p=q=1$ gives us a result of Mantaci, while setting $t=q=1$ gives us a result of Sivasubramanian. We also show that the fixed points of the involution map to Motzkin paths of height utmost 1 under the Foata-Zeilberger map. We extend the signed distribution result for descent length to the type B and type D Coxeter groups. Finally, as applications, we obtain a complete matching of the Bruhat order for $S_n$ and $B_n$ and we calculate the mean and variance the descent length statistic for permutations sampled from the alternating group at random. This is joint work with S. Sivasubramanian.

        <p>Some recent results on fractional intersecting families<br><hr>
        For a fraction $\theta = a/b$ in $(0,1)$, a family $\mathcal{F}$ of subsets of $[n]$ is called a "fractional $\theta$-intersecting family" if, for every pair of distinct sets $A, B \in \mathcal{F}$, we have $\lvert A \cap B \rvert = \theta \lvert A \rvert$ or $\theta \lvert B \rvert$. The natural extremal question is: How large can a $\theta$-intersecting family over $[n]$ be?

          This notion was introduced in Balachandran--Mathew--Mishra (Electron. J. Combin. 26 (2019), #P2.40), wherein they showed that $\lvert \mathcal{F} \rvert \leq O(n \log n)$, and they gave constructions of $\theta$-intersecting families of size at least $\Omega(n)$. The conjecture (which is still open) is that $\lvert \mathcal{F} \rvert \leq O(n)$ for any $\theta$-intersecting family $\mathcal{F}$ over $[n]$.
          
          In this talk, I will discuss some recent progress on this conjecture, and some related questions concerning ranks of certain matrix ensembles, tournaments, symmetric designs, and sunflowers.</p>

        <p>Characterization of $\theta$-free Matching Covered Graphs<br><hr>
          A nontrivial connected graph is matching covered if each edge belongs to some perfect matching. For most problems pertaining to perfect matchings, one may restrict attention to matching covered graphs; thus, there is an extensive theory on them. A cornerstone of this theory is an ear decomposition result due to Lovász and Plummer. Their theorem is a fundamental problem-solving tool, and also yields interesting open problems; we discuss two such problems below, and we solve one of them.

          A subgraph $H$ of a graph $G$ is <i>conformal</i> if $G-V(H)$ has a perfect matching. This notion is intrinsically related to the aforementioned ear decomposition theorem --- which implies that each matching covered graph (apart from $K_2$ and even cycles) contains a conformal bisubdivision of $\theta$, or a conformal bisubdivision of $K_4$, possibly both. (Here, $\theta$ refers to the graph with two vertices joined by three edges.) This immediately leads to two problems: characterize $\theta$-free (likewise, $K_4$-free) matching covered graphs. A characterization of planar $K_4$-free matching covered graphs was obtained by Kothari and Murty $(2016)$; the nonplanar case is still open.
          
          We provide a complete characterization of $\theta$-free matching covered graphs --- that is closely tied with the tight cut decomposition theory of matching covered graphs.  </p>

        <p>Square roots and character table sum<br><hr>
          The column sums of the character table of a finite group are always integers, which may also be negative. However, for finite Weyl groups (eg. symmetric group) these are non-negative. This is due to Frobenius and Schur, who interpreted column sums in terms of number of square roots of respective conjugacy classes. In this talk, we use their result to prove the validity of an intriguing property for Weyl groups (applicable to most finite groups) "The first column sum ( which records the dimensions of the irreducibles) dominate the sum of rest columns". While this property holds for any abelian group, generalized dihedral, and quaternionic groups, there are also a few exceptions. If time permits, we shall discuss the asymptotical behavior of the character table sums and derive their generating functions. This is an ongoing work with Arvind Ayyer and Hiranya Kishore Dey.</p>

        <p>Koszul Duality for Schur Algebras and $q$-Schur Algebras<br><hr>
          The category of degree $d$ polynomial representations of $GL_{n}(\mathbb{C})$ is isomorphic to the category of modules of the Schur algebra $S=S(n,d)$, $d\geq 0$. The $q$-Schur algebra $S_{q}(n,d)$ is a quantum analogue of Schur algebra $S(n,d)$ whose module theory essentially captures polynomial representations of the quantum general linear group $GL_{q}(n)$. Geetha, Prasad and Srivastava (Pac. J. Math., 2020) defined the Koszul duality functor $D:S-\text{Mod} \xrightarrow{} S-\text{Mod}$
          by $D(M)=S^{-}\otimes_{S} M$. This functor takes the Weyl module $W_{\lambda}$ to $W_{\lambda^{'}}$, for any partition $\lambda$ of $d$ with atmost $n$ parts. We will see an analogue of the Koszul duality functor for the $q$-Schur algebra $S_{q}(n,d)$. This is part of an ongoing work with A.~Prasad.

        <p>Zero-sum Problems for Restricted Sequences<br><hr>
          Zero-sum problems are basically combinatorial in nature. It deals with the condition that ensures that a given sequence over a finite group has a zero-sum subsequence with some prescribed properties. There are many invariants associated with zero-sum problems. Some such invariants are the Davenport constant, the Erdős-Ginzburg-Ziv constant, and the Harborth constant. The original motivation for introducing such group invariant was to study the problem of non-unique factorization domain over number fields. The precise value of such group invariants even for any finite abelian group are still unknown. In this talk, I will be discussing zero-sum problems over in some particular category of sequences. Moreover, we will study the behaviour of zero-sum invariants for random sequences.

          We introduce a new algebraic technique to enumerate the tiling of Aztec Diamond. The main idea is to understand the tiling problem of a region that is a union of two regions sharing a common boundary where the tiling enumeration is already known.

        <p>Sign-balance of excedances over Parity Alternating Permutations<br><hr>
          A permutation is called parity alternating if its entries assume even and odd integers alternately. In 2010, Tanimoto proved that the number of even non-parity alternating permutations with $k$ descents is same as the number of odd non-parity alternating permutations with $k$ descents. The objective of this paper is two-fold. 
          The first is to find out whether an excedance counterpart of Tanimoto's result is true. The second is to find out the sign-balance for parity alternating permutations with respect to the statistic excedance. The results of this paper can be considered as an applications of linear algebraic techniques in the area of combinatorics, which are obtained by constructing suitable matrices and connecting their determinants with the signed-excedance enumeration of parity alternating permutations. As an application of the signed excedance enumeration, we prove that when $n \equiv 2 \pmod 4$, the excedance enumerating polynomials over the even and odd parity alternating permutations starting with an odd integer in $\mathfrak{S}_n$ are gamma positive. The sign-balance of parity alternating permutations with respect to several other statistics are also obtained.

          We use the tiling method to give elementary combinatorial proofs of some celebrated q-series identities, such as Jacobi triple product identity, Rogers-Ramanujan identities, and some identities of Rogers. We give a tiling proof of the q-binomial theorem and a tiling interpretation of the q-binomial coefficients. A new generalized k-product q-series identity is also obtained by employing the <i>tiling method</i>, wherein the generating function of the set of all possible tilings of a rectangular board is computed in two different ways to obtain the desired q-series identity. Several new recursive q-series identities were also established. The `tiling-method' holds promise for giving an aesthetically pleasing approach to prove old and new q-series identities.

          <p>Solitary edges in cubic graphs<br><hr>
            Extensive research has been conducted on $2$-connected cubic~(aka $3$-regular) graphs. Petersen (1891) proved that every $2$-connected cubic graph has a perfect matching; and Sch\""onberger (1934) showed that each edge in a $2$-connected cubic graph is part of some perfect matching. In light of these well-known results, we set out to characterize those $2$-connected cubic graphs in which every edge is part of at least two perfect matchings.
          </p>
          <p>
            An edge is referred to as a {\em solitary edge} if it belongs to a unique perfect matching.
            Thus, we can restate our objective as characterizing all $2$-connected cubic graphs that do not contain any solitary edges. In case of $2$-connected, there are graphs with $\frac{n}{2}$ solitary edges, where $n$ is the number of vertices. The problem turns out to be more interesting in the case of $3$-connected graphs. We have successfully established a constant upper bound (namely, six) on the number of solitary edges in $3$-connected cubic graphs.\par
            A connected graph $G$ with two or more vertices is said to be {\em matching covered} if each edge is part of at least one perfect matching. The concept of dependency relationship between edges, in a matching covered graph, was formally introduced and studied by Carvalho, Lucchesi and Murty~(1999). In a matching covered graph $G$, the dependency relationship between edges $e$ and $f$ may be defined as follows: edge $e$ depends on edge $f$, denoted as $e \rightarrow f$, if every perfect matching that includes edge $e$ also includes edge $f$, and edges $e$ and $f$ are mutually dependent, denoted as $e \leftrightarrow f$, if both $e \rightarrow f$ and $f \rightarrow e$. It is worth noting that mutual dependence is an equivalence relation implies it partitions the edge set $E(G)$ into distinct equivalence classes. The parts of this partition are referred to as the {\em equivalence classes} of $G$. And we refer to an equivalence class, say $R$, as a {\em removable class} if $G-R$ is matching covered. We say any two edges in a matching covered graph are {\em mutually exclusive} if there is no perfect matching that contains both the edges. The set of solitary edges in a $3$-connected cubic graph may be partitioned into $3$ (possibly empty) parts so that any two edges in the same part are mutually dependent, any two edges in the distinct parts are mutually exclusive, and each part has cardinality at most two; we refer to part of cardinality one as {\em solitary singleton} and part of cardinality two as {\em solitary doubleton}. We provide a complete characterization of all cubic 3-connected graphs that have at least three solitary edges.\par

          <p>The bipartite Laplacian matrix of a nonsingular tree<br><hr>
            Similar to the bipartite adjacency matrix  (J. A. Bondy and U. S. R. Murty.  Graph theory, Springer-Verlag London, New York, 2008), we define the   bipartite distance matrix of a bipartite graph with a unique perfect matching. 
            The   bipartite distance matrix  $B(G)$ of a
            bipartite graph $G$ with a unique perfect matching on $2p$ vertices is a $p\times p$ matrix whose $(i, j)$th
            entry is the distance between vertices $l_i$ and $r_j$, where $L:=\{l_1,\ldots,l_p\}$, $R:=\{r_1,\ldots,r_p\}$ is a vertex bipartition of $G$.
            We observe that $\det {B}(G)$ is always a multiple of $2^{p-1}$.  
            Based on this observation, we define the {\em bipartite distance index} of $G$ as $\texttt{bd}(G):=\det  {B}(G)/ (-2)^{p-1}$.
          </p>
          <p>
            We demonstrate that the bipartite distance index of a nonsingular tree $T$ satisfies an interesting inclusion-exclusion
            type of principle at any matching edge of the tree.
            Furthermore, we fully characterize  the bipartite distance index of a nonsingular tree  $T$ by the structure of   $T$ through what we term $f$-alternating sums.
          </p>
          <p>
            The study of the inverse of the bipartite distance matrix  leads to an unexpected generalization of the usual Laplacian matrix for a tree, referred to as the  bipartite Laplacian matrix.  This generalized Laplacian matrix is usually not symmetric but it shares many properties with the usual Laplacian matrix.
            We study some of the fundamental properties of the bipartite Laplacian matrix and compare them with those of the usual Laplacian matrix. Lastly, we present a combinatorial description of all minors of the bipartite Laplacian matrix for a nonsingular tree.

          <p>A New Proof of an Additive Inversion Formula.<br><hr>
            Inversion formulas are extremely useful in combinatorics and number theory. We present an additive version of the well-known Mobius inversion formula. This involves the interesting function $h(r)$ which is a sum over all non-negative integer solutions of $1 b_1+...+ (r+1)b_{r+1}= 2r, b_1+...+b_{r+1}=r$, that is, over all integer partitions of $2r$ into exactly $r$ parts. This formula is equivalent to inverting a triangular Toeplitz matrix, as proved by Merca. Our proof of this inversion formula is combinatorial and new. The proof is a nice application of the principle of strong mathematical induction. We also have an application of the formula to obtain an anologue of a Guinand's result.

        <p>Planar Cycle-Extendable Graphs<br><hr>
        A nontrivial connected graph $G$ is said to be  matching covered if each edge is part of some perfect matching. Most of the problems in matching theory can be reduced to matching covered graphs. Such graphs are also known as  $1$-extendable graphs because each edge extends to a perfect matching. In a similar fashion, we say that a matching covered graph $G$ is  cycle-extendable if (either) perfect matching of each even cycle $Q$ extends to a perfect matching (of $G$). Equivalently, a matching covered graph is cycle-extendable if each even cycle can be expressed as a symmetric difference of two perfect matchings.

Another motivation to work on cycle-extendable graphs arises from the ear decomposition theory of matching covered graphs (that is similar to the well-known ear decomposition theory of 2-connected graphs). From this viewpoint, a matching covered graph $G$ is cycle-extendable if and only if each even cycle extends to an ear decomposition of $G$.

As of now, there is no known NP characterization of cycle-extendable graphs (in general). Recently, we obtained NP (as well as P) characterizations of planar cycle-extendable graphs. Xiaofeng Guo and Fuji Zhang (2004) obtained such a characterization for bipartite planar cycle-extendable graphs (wherein they refer to cycle-extendable graphs as $1$-cycle resonant graphs).
We provide a complete characterization of nonbipartite planar cycle-extendable graphs in terms of four infinite families.

For $r=1$, this reduces to the classical definition of Davenport constant, mentioned by K.

In this talk, we shall try to discover its behaviour for a certain class of groups of rank $\geq 3$, for which its value was not known before.

In this context, we usually call $p$ a pattern. The numbers we study are of the form $B_{n, p}(k)$, which is the number of binary words of length $n$ that have exactly $k$ occurrences of the pattern $p$. We first obtain an explicit formula for $B_{n, p}(k)$ for small values of $k$. We then turn to the numbers $M_{n, p}$, the maximum number of occurrences of $p$ that a word of length $n$ can have (the maximum value of $k$ for which $B_{n, p}(k) \neq 0$). We compute these numbers for certain special patterns $p$ and also address the following question: For any $k < M_{n, p}$, can we always find a word of length $n$ that has $k$ occurrences of $p$?

        Associating graphs with groups dates back to Arthur Cayley. 
Starting from Cayley graphs, the research on graphs defined on algebraic objects like groups, rings, vector spaces etc. forms an integral part of algebraic graph theory. In this talk, I am going to discuss about another such graph defined on group, called \textit{comaximal subgroup graph $\Gamma(G)$} of a group $G$. It is defined as a graph with vertex set is the collection of all non-trivial proper subgroups of $G$ and two vertices $H$ and $K$ are adjacent if $HK=G$. Though the definition allows the possibility of $G$ to be infinite, in this discussion, I will focus mainly on finite groups. I will discuss various graph parameters like diameter, connectedness, girth, bipartiteness etc. We will see how the properties of underlying group structure influence the properties of graph and vice-versa. I will also highlight some problems on realizability and graph isomorphisms, and some partial solutions to those questions in terms of properties of $G$.</p>

        <p>The bunkbed conjecture for the random cluster model<br><hr>
        The bunkbed conjecture is a well known unsolved problem in percolation theory that predicts that two natural notions of distance in graph theory should have the same qualitative behaviour. It says for instance that in a random edge subgraph of the n-hypercube, the probability that two points are in the same connected component is monotonically decreasing in their hamming distance. 
We explore this problem in the more general context of the random cluster model, which includes percolation as a special case and prove a number of results. In particular, we show that we can use linear algebraic arguments to prove the bunkbed conjecture for certain limiting cases of the random cluster measure. 
Our work naturally leads to some new and interesting correlation inequalities that extend the well known Rayleigh inequalities for spanning tree measures.

Various spectra, including adjacency, Laplacian, and signless Laplacian spectra, of any graph $G$, which is a $H_m$-join of graphs is obtained by introducing the concept of $E$-main eigenvalues. More precisely, we deduce that in the case of adjacency spectra, there is an associated matrix $E_i$ of the graph $G_i$ such that a $E_i$-non-main eigenvalue of multiplicity $m_i$ of $A(G_i)$ carry forward as an eigenvalue for $A(G)$ with the same multiplicity $m_i$, while an $E_i$-main eigenvalue of multiplicity $m_i$ carry forward as an eigenvalue of $G$ with multiplicity at least $m_i - m$.

        <p>Qualitative Independence Hypergraphs<br><hr>
        For positive integers $n$, $g$, and $t$ such that $t \geq 2$, $n \geq g^t$, a $t$-qualitative independence hypergraph,  $t$-$QI(n, g)$, is a $t$-uniform hypergraph where the vertices are partitions $\mathcal{P}_i=(P_{i}^1, P_{i}^2, \ldots, P_{i}^g)$ of an $n$-set into $g$ classes with the property that every class of the partition has size at least $g^{t-1}$, and a set of $t$ vertices $\{\mathcal{P}_{i_1}, \mathcal{P}_{i_2}, \ldots, \mathcal{P}_{i_t}\}$ forms a hyperedge if the intersection of any $t$ classes from different partitions is nonempty, that is, $P_{i_1}^{j_1}\cap P_{i_2}^{j_2}\cap \cdots \cap P_{i_t}^{j_t} \neq \emptyset$ for $1\leq j_1, j_2, \ldots, j_t \leq g$. The family of $t$-qualitative independence hypergraphs gives a significant characterization for the existence of covering arrays on hypergraphs, which are combinatorial designs used in the interaction testing of softwares. For a $t$-uniform hypergraph $H=(V, E)$, a covering array on $H$, denoted by $CA(n, H, g)$,  is an $n\times |V|$ matrix with entries from $\mathbb{Z}_g$ such that for every $t$ columns forming a hyperedge, every ordered $t$-tuple from $\mathbb{Z}_g^t$ appears in at least one row. A covering array with the least possible number of rows is called optimal. For a hypergraph $H$ and positive integers $g$ and $n$, a $CA(n, H, g)$ exists if and only if there is a hypergraph homomorphism $H \to t\text{-}QI(n, g)$. The question is: What is the minimum $n$ that guarantees the existence of such a homomorphism? In 2005, K. Meagher and B. Stevens (Covering Arrays on Graphs, Journal of Combinatorial Theory, Series B) showed that there is no homomorphism $2\text{-}QI(n, 2) \to 2\text{-}QI(n-1, 2)$. We study the strong chromatic number of $3\text{-}QI(n, 2)$ and establish the non-existence of a hypergraph homomorphism $3\text{-}QI(n, 2)\to 3\text{-}QI(n-1, 2)$. Consequently, we prove that an optimal covering array on $3\text{-}QI(n, 2)$ has precisely $n$ rows. This is a joint work with Dr. Yasmeen Akhtar, BITS Pilani, K K Birla Goa Campus. </p>

        For a finite group $G$, let $B$ be an equivalence (equality, conjugacy or order) relation on  $G$ and let $A$ be a (power, enhanced power or commuting) graph with vertex set $G$. The $B$ super $A$ graph  is a simple graph with vertex set $G$ and two vertices are adjacent if either they are in the same $B$-equivalence class or there are elements in their $B$-equivalence classes that are adjacent in the original $A$ graph. The graph obtained by deleting the dominant vertices (adjacent to all other vertices) from a $B$ super $A$ graph is called the reduced $B$ super $A$ graph. In this presentation, for some pairs of $B$ super $A$ graphs, we characterize the finite groups  for which a pair of graphs are equal. We also characterize  the dominant vertices for the order super commuting graph $\Delta^o(G)$ of $G$ and  prove that for $n\geq 4$ the identity element is the only dominant vertex of  $\Delta^o(S_n)$ and $\Delta^o(A_n)$. We characterize the values of $n$ for which the reduced order super commuting graph $\Delta^o(S_n)^*$ of $S_n$ and the reduced order super commuting graph $\Delta^o(A_n)^*$ of $A_n$ are connected. We also prove that if $\Delta^o(S_n)^*$ (or  $\Delta^o(A_n)^*$) is  connected then the diameter is at most $3$ and show that the diameter is $3$ for many value of $n.$ Later we will introduce the notion of generalized join and compressed of a graph with respect to certain equivalence relation on the vertex set. With the help of this notion, we will find the adjacency and Laplacian spectrum of conjugacy and order super commuting graphs of dihedral group $D_{2n}\; (n\geq 3)$, generalized quaternion group $Q_{4m} \;(m\geq 2)$ and the nonabelian group $\mathbb Z_p \rtimes \mathbb Z_q$ of order $pq$, where $p$ and $q$ are distinct primes with $q|p-1$.</p>
